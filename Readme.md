}

// Tree Traversal Template
void traverse(TreeNode* root) {
    if(!root) return;
    // pre-order logic
    traverse(root->left);
    // in-order logic  
    traverse(root->right);
    // post-order logic
}

// DP Template
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        dp[i][j] = // recurrence relation
